 A manufacturer of metal pistons finds that on average, 12% of his pistons are rejected because they are either oversized or undersized.
 What is the probability that a batch of 10 pistons will contain:

(a) no more than 2 rejects? = p0 + p1 + p2 = 0.891

(b) at least 2 rejects? = 1 - ( p0 + p1 ) = 0.342
 */

public class Solution {

    /**
     * p ( rejected piston ) = 0.12
     *
     * p0 = p ( no rejected piston in a batch of 10 )        = 0.2785
     * p1 = p ( exactly 1 rejected piston in a batch of 10 ) = 0.3797
     * p2 = p ( exactly 2 rejected pistons in a batch of 10) = 0.2330
     */
}
